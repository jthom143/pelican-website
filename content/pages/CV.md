## Research Experience:
* Johns Hopkins January 2013 - Present
    * Analyzed GFDL CM2Mc 500 year pre-industrial model output in order to isolate natural variability of oceanic circulation and overturning in the Southern Hemisphere. Current research leading to analyzing the effects the ozone hole has on atmospheric and oceanic general circulation and oceanic uptake of CO2.

* CalNex 2010 May 2010 – August 2012
    * Participated in a two-month field study in Bakersfield, CA studying oxidation photochemistry and preformed analysis and model comparison of collected data under the direction of Dr. William Brune.

* Falmouth, UK July 2011
    * Participated in a two-week marine science field study through the University of Southampton in Falmouth, UK.

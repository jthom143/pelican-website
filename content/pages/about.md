My name is Jordan Thomas and I am a third year graduate student in the [Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences](http://eps.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu/). I am currently working with Dr. Darryn Waugh on quantifying the natural variability in the Southern Annular Mode and westerly jet in CMIP5 models.
